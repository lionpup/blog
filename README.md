Authors,

If you're willing to learn minimal coding, Github Pages is a free option for your website.

Instructions:

1. Go to [github.com](github.com) and sign up. Don't forget to verify your email.
2. Once signed in, create a new repository.
Conceptually, a repository is a project folder for your website. It has to be named as {your_username}.github.io (replace {your_username} with the username you chose in step 1.

3. If you're not familiar with rest of the options, then just click on the Create button.
Don't make your repository private. Github charges a monthly fee to host pages for private repositories. AFAIK, there isn't any downside to make your source code public.

4. After clicking on the Create button, you're redirected to this page with a ton of scarry crap. Don't be intimidated. Look for the Settings tab and click on it.

5. Scroll down. There is a section called "GitHub Pages". Change "Source" to master branch, and select a theme. Whala! Your website is available at https://{your_username}.github.io
